<p class="bigger">Two decades after the domain <strong>js.org</strong> was registered for the first time, it finally serves its obvious purpose - the JavaScript community.</p>
   <p>Right from the beginning opinions about JavaScript varied - some people love the language, others hate it. But there should be no doubt about the <strong>awesomeness of the community</strong> that made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages.<br>In alignment to the <strong>free-and-open</strong> mindset of the community, JS.ORG made <strong>subdomains</strong> available for developers and their projects for free. Since this first step we also focused on tracking JavaScript <strong>trends</strong> and spreading <strong>news</strong> about it.</p>

   <p><strong>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME</strong>: If you have the passion to start a collaborative project, or if you want to be a member of and contribute to JS.ORG, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/js-org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GitHub user profile"><strong>contact me</strong></a>.</p>

         <h3><a href="https://columbinespace.github.io/columbine.space/dns.html">dns</a></h3>
         You might have a site on something like Google Sites or GitHub Pages. Let's give your site a sleek name, like <strong><a href=dns.columbine.space>dns.columbine.space</a></strong>. We'd like to point out that this isn't a host -- you'll still be using something like Google Sites to be building the actual site. So instead of columbinespace.github.io/services/DNS/, it'll be something like dns.columbine.space.
