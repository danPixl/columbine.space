<p class="bigger">Two decades after the domain <strong>js.org</strong> was registered for the first time, it finally serves its obvious purpose - the JavaScript community.</p>
   <p>Right from the beginning opinions about JavaScript varied - some people love the language, others hate it. But there should be no doubt about the <strong>awesomeness of the community</strong> that made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages.<br>In alignment to the <strong>free-and-open</strong> mindset of the community, JS.ORG made <strong>subdomains</strong> available for developers and their projects for free. Since this first step we also focused on tracking JavaScript <strong>trends</strong> and spreading <strong>news</strong> about it.</p>

   <p><strong>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME</strong>: If you have the passion to start a collaborative project, or if you want to be a member of and contribute to JS.ORG, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/js-org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="GitHub user profile"><strong>contact me</strong></a>.</p>

         <h3><a href="https://sites.google.com">google sites</a></h3>
         <p>So, you have a website on Google Sites. Let's get it an awesome subdomain. </p>
         <p>1. On <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools"><strong> Webmaster Tools</strong></a>, enter what domain you'd like, for example, danny.columbine.space. Click on 'Add Property'.</p>
         <p>2. Select 'Alternate methods', select 'Domain name provider', then scroll down and select 'Other'. Don't close the tab yet.</p>
         <p>3. Copy the TXT record that you got from step 2, and <a href=https://github.com/ColumbineSpace/DNS/issues><strong>file an issue on GitHub</strong></a>, with the name of the issue being the domain, and the description being the TXT record.</p>
         <p>4. After we've told you via GitHub that we've added the domain, click 'Verify' in Google Webmaster Tools.</p>
